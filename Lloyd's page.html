	Hello everyone! Welcome to Lloyd's page!
</p>

<p class="container">
	Hey Everyone! A little bit about me, I was born in 1996 in Bethesda,
	Maryland. I love video games and anime. I mainly play JRPG games,
	but I do play
	games like Diablo and Call of Duty. Pokemon, the Fire Emblem and 
	the Tales of series
	are a few of my favorite games. Video Games and Anime have been
	a huge part in my life, as they have taught me many things.
	I didn't have too many friends growing up and mostly just stayed
	to myself playing video games. I'm not sure what anime was my first, 
	but Pokemon is the first I can remember. I started watching Naruto 
	after a while and I really enjoyed that anime. I have become more
	social in my teen years and have many friends, but games and 
	anime is still a huge part of my life. 
</p>

<p class="container">
	A little bit more about my personal life, I plan to go to college 
	in Minnesota to study web and multimedia, hence why this website 
	is here haha. I play video games, read manga and watch anime all 
	the time. Some of my personal favorite anime: Sword Art Online, 
	Highschool DxD, World Trigger, Problem Children From Another World. 
	The list can go on and on haha! Next, some of my favorite video 
	games: Fire Emblem, Tales of Symphonia, Diablo 3, Pokemon, Sword 
	Art Online, The Witcher 3. I also play some video games on my phone 
	and iPad, like Clash of Clans.
