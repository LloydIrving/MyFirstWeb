		Hello everyone! Welcome to Lloyd's page!

			Hey Everyone! A little bit about me, I was born in 1996 in Bethesda,
			Maryland. I love video games and anime. I mainly play JRPG games,
			but I do play
			games like Diablo and Call of Duty. Pokemon, the Fire Emblem and 
			the Tales of series
			are a few of my favorite games. Video Games and Anime have been
			a huge part in my life, as they have taught me many things.
			I didn't have too many friends growing up and mostly just stayed
			to myself playing video games. I'm not sure what anime was my first, 
			but Pokemon is the first I can remember. I started watching Naruto 
			after a while and I really enjoyed that anime. I have become more
			social in my teen years and have many friends, but games and 
			anime is still a huge part of my life.

			A little bit more about my personal life, I plan to go to college 
			in Minnesota to study web and multimedia, hence why this website 
			is here haha. I play video games, read manga and watch anime all 
			the time. Some of my personal favorite anime: Sword Art Online, 
			Highschool DxD, World Trigger, Problem Children From Another World. 
			The list can go on and on haha! Next, some of my favorite video 
			games: Fire Emblem, Tales of Symphonia, Diablo 3, Pokemon, Sword 
			Art Online, The Witcher 3. I also play some video games on my phone 
			and iPad, like Clash of Clans.
