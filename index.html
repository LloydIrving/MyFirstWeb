	Hello everyone! Welcome to our homepage!
	</p>

	<p class="announcements">
		This website is to show our fans, old or new, what we do, how we 
		do it, and a little bit about us. Updates about us will come 
		mostly from here, but we also talk on our Facebook pages! If you 
		need a tutorial on a game, which both of us do tutorials for, we 
		may be able to help! 
	<p>

	<p class="announcements">
		Lloyd mainly plays JRPG games, but does also
		play other games. He can take a request and if he likes how it 
		looks and can acquire it, he will make a tutorial on it.  
	</p>

	<p class="announcements">
		If 
		you want to learn about Python or other similar coding 
		applications, have questions regarding biology, or have computer 
		questions, Mike is the guy to go to.
